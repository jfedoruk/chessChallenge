# Chess Challenge by Scalac

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with
dimensions MÃ—N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number of  
results is useful, but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does not  
matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.
